# üßæ Basic Invoice Generator using Python OOP

This is a **console-based invoice generator** built using fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. It allows users to input product details, calculate totals, and export a well-formatted invoice to a `.txt` file.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

To demonstrate clean OOP design by simulating a real-world invoice system. Users can:

- Add multiple products
- Automatically calculate totals
- Generate a readable invoice
- Export the invoice to a `.txt` file

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ Add multiple products with name, quantity, and unit price  
‚úÖ Automatic subtotal and grand total calculation  
‚úÖ Export final invoice as a `.txt` file  
‚úÖ Input validation and error handling  
‚úÖ Fully modular code using OOP principles

## üîç Object-Oriented Concepts Used

| Concept          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Classes**      | `Product`, `Invoice` classes to represent real-world entities |
| **Encapsulation**| Data and methods grouped logically in classes |
| **Abstraction**  | Details of invoice generation hidden in class methods |
| **Exception Handling** | Input validation and error messaging |
| **File Handling** | Invoice is saved as a `.txt` file |

---

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: Python Standard Library (`datetime`)  
- **Output**: `.txt` invoice file (human-readable)
